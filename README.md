# Welcome to Mike Trzaska's GitHub Portfolio!

## About Me
Hey there! I'm Mike Trzaska (HokageM), a passionate learner and explorer in the world of technology. 
I earned my Bachelor of Science degree at the Technical University of Hamburg Harburg in Computer Science and Electrical
Engineering. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Hamburg.

Since October 2020, I have been working as a Working Student (Software Engineer) at Eppendorf Liquid Handling GmbH. 
In parallel, since April 2025, I have also been working on my Master's thesis at Eppendorf SE.
During my time at Eppendorf, I have had the opportunity to contribute to various projects, 
primarily focusing on firmware development in C++ and tool development in Python. 
I also completed my Bachelor's thesis at Eppendorf, where I developed a GUI testing tool for embedded systems.

I deeply enjoy working on diverse projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer.
