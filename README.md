# Welcome to Mike Trzaska's GitHub Portfolio!

## About Me
Hey there! I'm Mike Trzaska (HokageM), a passionate learner and explorer in the world of technology. 
I earned my Bachelor of Science degree at the Technical University of Hamburg Harburg in Computer Science and Electrical
Engineering. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Hamburg.

Since October 2020, I've been working as a Working Student (Software Engineer) at Eppendorf Liquid Handling GmbH. 
During my time at Eppendorf, I had the opportunity to work on various projects and technologies, primarily focusing on 
C++ and Python. Additionally, I completed my Bachelor Thesis at Eppendorf, where I developed a tool for GUI testing for 
embedded systems.

I deeply enjoy working on diverse projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer. 
Most of my personal projects are in Python.


## Portfolio

### Bioinformatics Projects
- **CoAler**
  - CoAler (Core Aligner), a tool capable of efficiently calculating multi-alignments for dozens of molecules from scratch within minutes on a standard desktop computer.

- **DamagedLoggingAnalyzer**
  - This is my individual project for the module Research Software Engineering in SS24. The task was to analyze a dataset 
  from [genesis.destatis](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online?operation=abruftabelleBearbeiten&levelindex=1&levelid=1713202276894&auswahloperation=abruftabelleAuspraegungAuswaehlen&auswahlverzeichnis=ordnungsstruktur&auswahlziel=werteabruf&code=41261-0003&auswahltext=&werteabruf=starten) using Python and to find interesting aspects and potential questions that could be explored using this data.
